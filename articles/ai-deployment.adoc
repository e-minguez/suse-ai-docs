WHAT?::
  {productname} is a multi-layered enterprise AI solution that consists of several software components and dependencies.

WHY?::
  Use this guide to deploy and install {productname} and its dependencies in a consistent and supported manner.

EFFORT::
  It takes less than one hour of reading time and requires advanced knowledge of Linux deployment.

GOAL::
  By the end of this guide, you will have {productname} and all required dependencies installed and ready for use.

{productname} is a versatile product consisting of multiple software
layers and components. This document outlines the complete workflow
for deployment and installation of all {productname} dependencies, as
well as {productname} itself. You can also find references to
recommended hardware and software requirements, as well as steps to
take after the product installation.

== Alternative deployments

Selected parts of {productname} deployment can be automated or performed in a Web UI environment instead of the command line.
This includes the following methods:

* Preparing and configuring {suse}-based servers for AI workloads.
  This includes deployment of {rke2a}, {ranchera} or {rancherprime}, and {nvidia} GPU driver and {nvoperator} using xref:ai-node-installer[{sainodeinstaller}].
* Deploying {productname} workloads using xref:ailibrary-installing-deployer[{saideployer}].
* Deploying {productname} workloads using xref:ai-lifecycle-manager[{sailifecyclemanager}].
